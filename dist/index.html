            <p class="p-6">When will we finally be able to collectively understand our own best interests? It seems like Mr. Harrison Barrett did when he first purchased his land in 1876. <br><br>I myself live in this once productive African freedmen settlement that was established after the civil war, and have witnessed the downward spiral in productivity and community cohesion, ironically the little time I have resided here. <br><br>This historically black owned and ran town is around 12.66 square miles, and it has aproximately 12 churches in total in this town. That is 1 church per square mile. <br><br>We need more groups petitioning to <a class="text-blue-700" href="https://www.pct3.com/Projects">Harris County</a> for sidewalks and wider roads. We need higher community expectations, of local business practices, and up-keep of public appearance and business property. We need the locals to value their own enterprise so we can compete with the town of Crosby, Tx at least in the food service industry. <br><br>From my stance, I am certainly for the progress of my people and the town of Barrett Station, Tx in it's entirety, I have the same vision for this town as the founder Harrison Barrett did, back in the late 19th century. <br><br>I want to see local shopping plazas where the good people of Barrett Station, Tx can get the things they need to carry on with their day, without having to leave the city limits, or to deal with unpleasant conditions like the local Barrett Grocery store for example. <br><br>I am a concerned local business owner that sees the potential it could ultimately reach with a little community cohesion.<br><br>But what was it that changed so much that it stunted the growth of local small businesses? I think it can be related to a number of things, but culture would be the main cause as it seems there was a shift from entreprenuership to the workforce primarily.</p>
